# Contract interaction using Etherscan

> You can connect your wallet on Etherscan and call contract functions.

Read-only functions can be used on the Read Contract or Read as Proxy pages, and state-changing functions can be called on the Write Contract or Write as Proxy pages.

## Read calls
On the contract's Read Contract or Read as Proxy page, you can see the available view functions. Enter the parameters according to the function interface and click the query button to see the result.
